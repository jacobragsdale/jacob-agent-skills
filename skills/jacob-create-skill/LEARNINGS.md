# Learnings

Dated corrections from real use of this skill. Read before executing;
fold recurring/confirmed entries into SKILL.md and delete them here.

- 2026-07-01: Web research delivered a stale diagnostic-rule name (reportPossiblyUnbound vs the real reportPossiblyUnboundVariable); running the bundled script against the actual tool caught it → when a skill encodes tool-specific identifiers (rule names, flags, config keys), execute the tool once during creation to reconcile them, and make scripts degrade gracefully on unknown identifiers since they drift between versions.
- 2026-07-01: Drafted SKILL.md by overwriting the scaffolded file with a full-file Write, silently dropping the seeded `disable-model-invocation: true`; user then had to request it repo-wide → edit the scaffolded SKILL.md in place, section by section, keeping its frontmatter intact.
- 2026-07-02: user asked for an "always on" skill -> a skill alone cannot be always-on; before scaffolding, split the mechanism (AGENTS.md rules / hooks carry the always part, the skill carries the logic + files) and confirm which agent is first-class -- it inverts the wiring.
